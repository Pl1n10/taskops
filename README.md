# TaskOps starter kit

So you want to be a TaskOps?

First, learn about [task](https://taskfile.dev)

Then stud the provded examples: 
- `docker-redis` manages redis in docker
- `kube-kind` manages a single node kubernetes cluster in docker
- `kube-redis` manages a redis deployment in redis

Examples are super simple and for training purporses.

They are Unix only, so you can run them in Linux, Mac OS and Windws Bash (**do not use powershell**)

To see actual production code learn abod [ops](https://github.com/apache/openserverless-cli) and its [tasks](https://github.com/apache/openserverless-task)

Once you studied this, fork this repo, look at the issues and contribute a PR solving one (or more).
