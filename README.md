So you want to be a TaskOps?

First, learn about [task](https://taskfile.dev)

Then study the provded examples: 
- `docker-redis` manages redis in docker
- `kube-kind` manages a single node kubernetes cluster in docker
- `kube-redis` manages a redis deployment in redis

Examples are super simple and for training purposes only.

To see actual production code to write learn about [ops](https://github.com/apache/openserverless-cli), a super set of task, and give a look to its [task library](https://github.com/apache/openserverless-task) that is the core of the OpenServerless CLI

They are Unix only, so you can run them in Linux, Mac OS and Windows WSL. Powershell is **NOT** supported, it may works... or not. No guarantee.
